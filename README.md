## Dinosaur Game
An Arduino-based version of the classic Google Chrome Dinosaur Game.

### Components:
- Arduino board
- OLED Display or LCD
- Push button
- Buzzer (optional for sound effects)

### Description:
This project replicates the popular Chrome Dinosaur Game on an Arduino. The player controls a dinosaur that jumps over obstacles by pressing a button. The game logic includes scoring and increasing difficulty over time.

### Features:
- Simple button-based controls
- Display score and obstacles
- Increasing difficulty over time

### How to Play:
Press the button to make the dinosaur jump and avoid obstacles. The game speed increases as you progress, making it more challenging!
